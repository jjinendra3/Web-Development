        <li>I started to work hard in my academics, and after scoring 96.4% in Class 10 (CBSE) and 95.5% in Class 12 (PCM CBSE), here I am, a first-year engineering student at Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, Noida.</li>
        <li>Outside of the curriculum, I've been an actor since I was two years old when I did my first stage play. Since then, I have participated in various school and community theater plays and have won various theater competitions.</li>
        <ul><li>I have also been a Debater, and have represented my school in various interschool competitions such as Page Rajniti organized by DPS Greater Noida.
